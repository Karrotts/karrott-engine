# Getting Started with Karrott Engine
Hello, and welcome to the Karrott Engine documentation. This guide is intended to help you set up Karrott Engine in your Unity project and take you through the different systems within Karrott Engine.

## Installation and Setup


## Grid System


## Entity System
An entity is any game object that has been instantiated in the game world. The entity system allows us to mange those game objects that were created. Additionally, entities have some additonal properties that allow you categorize entities by a certain type.

In order for the entity system to be used, the entity's game object **must** be instantiated in the game world.
